  %h2 1. Stopping the Instance

  %p
    Shutting down a running instance is very simple.

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        On the same screen the ssh key and public address were available
        switch to the grid view by clicking the grid button on the right
        side of the page.

      %li
        Tick the checkbox next to the instance name in the instance list.
        
      %li
        Click the "Stop Selected Instances" button:
        
  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %center
      %a{ :href => "images/getting_started/aeolus_stop_instance_button.png",
          :target => "_blank" }
        %img.thumbnail{ :src => "images/getting_started/thumbnails/aeolus_stop_instance_button_thumb.png",
              :title => "Shutting down the instance - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Shutting down the instance - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %p
    Within a minute or two the instance status should change to say
    <em>stopped</em>:

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %center
      %a{ :href => "images/getting_started/aeolus_instance_stopped.png",
          :target => "_blank" }
        %img.thumbnail{ :src => "images/getting_started/thumbnails/aeolus_instance_stopped_thumb.png",
              :title => "Instance has stopped - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Instance has stopped - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %h2 2. Check for instances left running in EC2

  %p
    When using a development version of Aeolus, always remember to check the
    AWS Management Console for instances left running in EC2.

  %p
    It's rare for this to happen, but better safe than sorry:

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %img{ :src => "images/getting_started/ec2_instance_clean_up.png",
          :title => "Check AWS for EC2 instances left running",
          :alt => "Check AWS for EC2 instances left running" }
