%h1 Spherical

.section-grouping
  %p
    Spherical is a light-weight, Ruby wrapper for the VMware VI API.

  %p
    It provides a clean interface to all functionality offered by vSphere and
    ESX servers, including traversal of complex datatypes.

  %p
    Spherical dynamically abstracts the server-side object graph locally,
    and allows for full extensibility. 

  %p
    For detailed API information, see the
    %a{ :href => "http://rubydoc.info/github/kenkeiter/spherical/",
        :title => "Spherical documentation" } auto-generated documentation
    or the
    <a href="https://github.com/kenkeiter/spherical" title="Spherical GitHub project">Spherical GitHub project</a>.

  %h2 Getting Started

  %p
    We are currently in the process of converting Spherical to a rubygem. In
    the meantime, you can simply add it to your project's path.

  %p
    To begin using Spherical, you'll need to retrieve the latest version from
    the git repository, and ensure the prerequisite rubygems are installed.

  %p
    Ensure you have
    %b rubygems
    installed, and install the prerequisite rubygems by running:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ gem install savon
        $ gem install xml-simple
        $ gem install rspec

  %p
    Assuming the prerequisite gems install successfully, you will then need
    to clone the latest version of Spherical from the git repository.

  %p
    Ensure you have
    %b git
    installed, then run the following command:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ git clone git://github.com/kenkeiter/spherical.git

  %p
    This will clone the Spherical repository. Since Spherical is not yet a
    gem and cannot be installed, you need to add the path of Spherical's
    %b lib/
    folder to your Ruby application manually.

  %h3 Example

  %p
    Let's assume you want to use Spherical with a script in your home
    directory:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        /home/joeuser/list_vms.rb

  %p
    We'll also assume you've moved your clone of the Spherical repository
    to:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        /home/joeuser/spherical

  %p
    To add the Spherical library to the path, and import it, you would add
    the following lines to the top of the script:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        $: << File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'spherical/lib')
        require 'spherical'

  %p
    The
    %b Spherical
    module should now load into your script at runtime.

  %h2 Using Spherical

  %p
    In the previous section, we detailed how to include the
    %b Spherical
    module in an example Ruby script called <tt>list_vms.rb</tt>. To get you
    started using Spherical, we'll create a script to list all VMs in a
    vSphere (or ESX) server's inventory.

  %p
    In order to connect to a vSphere or ESX server, you'll need to
    instantiate a
    %b Host
    instance with an API endpoint and login credentials:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        require 'spherical'

        host = Spherical::Host.new :api => 'https://my.vsphere.server/sdk',
                                   :username => 'username',
                                   :password => 'password'

  %p
    As you know, your instances are organized in datacenters. Either select
    a datacenter manually, or recurse over all the datacenters listed in the
    system, then recurse over the VM inventory for each datacenter.

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        host.datacenters.each do |datacenter|
          # Recurse over VMs in the datacenter's inventory and print the MAC
          # addresses of each NIC interface in relation to the device name.
          datacenter.inventory.each do |vm|
            puts "Discovered VM \#{vm.name} in \#{datacenter.id}:"
            vm.mac_addresses.each do |if_name, address|
              puts "\t\#{if_name} => \#{address}"
            end
          end

        end

  %p
    Of course, Spherical can also interact with and perform control
    operations on VMs.  Please see the
    %tt examples
    folder in the Spherical repository or
    <a href="https://github.com/kenkeiter/spherical" title="Spherical's GitHub page">Spherical's GitHub page</a>.

    Additionally, a great deal of useful

        :title => "auto-generated Spherical documentation" }auto-generated documentation
    is available.

  %h2 Maintenance

  %p
    Spherical is a work in progress, and its API is still evolving.

  %p
    It is currently maintained by Ken Keiter (a.k.a.
