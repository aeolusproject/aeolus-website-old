%h1(id="ec2" style="margin-top:0") Amazon EC2

.warning
  %b WARNING:
  Amazon and other Cloud providers charge fees for using their products and
  services, including EC2.

  %p
    Setting up EC2 with Aeolus means your Amazon EC2 account will be billed
    with their appropriate usage charges as you follow this guide and/or try
    things out.

  %p
    We
    %b ARE NOT
    responsible for any EC2 or other Cloud fees and charges you may incur.
  
  %p
    As a precaution after finishing every Aeolus testing session, you
    %b must
    manually check all storage and instances in Amazon have been terminated
    and removed as you expect.

  %p
    Development versions of Aeolus have on occasion been known to report
    instances as stopped when they are in fact still running in EC2, thereby
    incurring charges from Amazon.

  %p
    %b BE CAREFUL!

  %h2 2. x.509 Certificates

  %p
    If you already have an existing EC2 x.509 certificate and private key,
    use those for the key and certificate fields.

  %p
    Alternatively, or if you don't have an X.509 Certificate yet, you can
    create a new one:

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        On the AWS
        <a href="https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key"
        title="Security Credentials">Account &rArr; Security Credentials</a>
        page, under
        %b Access Credentials
        click the
        %em X.509 Certificates
        tab.

      %li
        Click <b>Create a new Certificate</b>.
        %br
        %br
        A new window will open giving options to download and save the Private
        Key and X.509 Certificate files.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        Download and save the Private Key file using a name that is clear to
        understand, such as <em>EC2 x509 Private Key.pem</em>.

      %li
        Download and save the Certificate file using a name that is clear to
        understand, such as <em>EC2 x509 Certificate.pem</em>.

      %li
        Back in Aeolus, use the
        %em EC2 x509 Private Key.pem
        file for the key field.
        %br
    
      %li
        Use the
        %em EC2 x509 Certificate.pem
        file for the certificate field.
        %br

      %li
        Click the
        %b Save
        button.

  %p
    This will take you back to the
    %b PROVIDER ACCOUNT
    screen.  The new EC2 account should be listed.

  %p
    If this does not happen, and you are presented with different behaviour
    (such as an error message), please report it to us on the
    %a{ :href => "contact.html#developer" } aeolus-devel
    mailing list.
