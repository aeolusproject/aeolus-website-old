  %h3(id="ex1") Example 1 - Minimal guest

  %p
    Assume we want to install a minimal Fedora 13 x86_64 OS, from a Fedora 13
    DVD ISO located at:

  %p
    %pre
      http://<span style="color: blue">example.org</span>/fedora-13-x86_64.iso

  %p
    To do this install, we first build a TDL XML file, then feed it to
    oz-install.  The TDL file would need to look like:

  %pre
    :preserve
      &lt;template&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;fedora13_x86_64&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;os&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;Fedora&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;version&gt;13&lt;/version&gt;
          &lt;arch&gt;x86_64&lt;/arch&gt;
          &lt;install type='iso'&gt;
            &lt;iso&gt;http://example.org/fedora-13-x86_64.iso&lt;/iso&gt;
          &lt;/install&gt;
        &lt;/os&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;My Fedora 13 x86_64 template&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;/template&gt;

  %p
    That's it!  As you can see, we build the TDL to tell it what operating
    system we want (template &rArr; os &rArr; name), what version of the
    operating system (template &rArr; os &rArr; version), what architecture
    (template &rArr; os &rArr; arch), and where the installation DVD is
    located (template &rArr; os &rArr; install &rArr; iso).

  %p
    With that information in hand, Oz knows enough to actually install a
    minimal guest.

  %p
    To actually do the installation, the oz package needs to be installed and
    then you can run:

  %p
    %pre
      \# oz-install /path/to/fedora13.tdl

  .note
    %p
      For the time being, all of the oz commands need to be run as root,
      although we are working on making it work for normal users.
  
  %p
    Running this command will download and prepare the installation CD, and
    then run an automated install in a KVM guest from that installation CD.
    Assuming the install succeeds, the minimal operating system will be
    installed on a file in /var/lib/libvirt/images/fedora13_x86_64.dsk
    (by default).

  %h3(id="ex2") Example 2 - Guest with additional packages

  %p
  Assume that we want to install a Fedora 14 x86_64 operating system from a
  Fedora 14 DVD ISO that we have located at:

  %p
    %pre
      http://<span style="color: blue">example.org</span>/fedora-14-x86_64.iso

  %p
    Additionally assume we want to install the postgresql-server on the
    operating system.  To do this install, we first need to build a TDL XML
    file, and then feed that to oz-install.  The TDL file would need to look
    like:

  %pre
    :preserve
      &lt;template&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;fedora14_postgres&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;os&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;Fedora&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;version&gt;14&lt;/version&gt;
          &lt;arch&gt;x86_64&lt;/arch&gt;
          &lt;install type='iso'&gt;
            &lt;iso&gt;http://example.org/fedora-14-x86_64.iso&lt;/iso&gt;
          &lt;/install&gt;
        &lt;/os&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Fedora 14 x86_64 with postgres&lt;/description&gt;
        <span style="color: chartreuse">&lt;packages&gt;
          &lt;package name='postgresql-server'/&gt;
        &lt;/packages&gt;</span>
      &lt;/template&gt;

  %p
    This is very similar to Example 1, except we specified an additional
    package to be installed.  Running the installation is done the same way
    as in Example 1, except we have to add a command-line parameter to
    actually do the customization:

  %p
    %pre
      \# oz-install -u /path/to/fedora14.tdl"

  %p
    Running this command will download and prepare the installation CD, and
    then run an automated install in a KVM guest from that installation CD.

  %p
    Assuming the initial install succeeds, Oz will then boot the operating
    system and run native commands (in this case, "yum -y install
    postgresql-server") to install the additional packages. For more
    information about why this approach is used, please see the
    <a href="oz-architecture.html">Oz Architecture</a> page.

  %p
    Assuming this step succeeds, the operating system with the additional
    packages will be installed on a file in /var/lib/libvirt/images/fedora14_postgres.dsk (by default).

  %h3(id="ex3") Example 3 - Generate package manifest (ICICLE) after installation

  %p
    Assume we want to install a RHEL-5 x86_64 operating system from a RHEL-5
    DVD ISO located at:

  %p
    %pre
      http://<span style="color: blue">example.org</span>/rhel-5-x86_64.iso

  %p
    Additionally assume we want to get a package manifest out of the
    operating system after the install is done.  To do this install, we first
    need to build a TDL XML file, then feed that to oz-install.  The TDL file
    would need to look like:

  %pre
    :preserve
      &lt;template&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;rhel5_x86_64&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;os&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;<span style="color: chartreuse">RHEL-5</span>&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;version&gt;U6&lt;/version&gt;
          &lt;arch&gt;x86_64&lt;/arch&gt;
          &lt;install type='iso'&gt;
            &lt;iso&gt;http://example.org/rhel-5-x86_64.iso&lt;/iso&gt;
          &lt;/install&gt;
        &lt;/os&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;RHEL-5 x86_64&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;/template&gt;

  %p
    This is essentially the same as Example 1, except we want to install
    RHEL-5 instead of Fedora-13.

  %p
    Running the installation is done the same way as in Example 1, except we
    have to add a command-line parameter to generate the manifest at the end:

  %p
    %pre
      \# oz-install -g /path/to/rhel5.tdl

  %p
    Running this command will download and prepare the installation CD, then
    run an automated install in a KVM guest from that installation CD.

  %p
    Assuming the initial install succeeds, Oz will then boot the operating
    system and run native commands (in this case, "rpm -qa") to query all of
    the packages in the system.  It will then output an XML document
    describing the entire manifest.

  %p
    Assuming this step succeeds, the minimal operating system will be installed on
    a file in /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel5_x86_64.dsk (by default).
