%h1(id="aeolus-conductor")Aeolus Conductor

%p
  Aeolus Conductor provides a web-based user interface for managing your
  Cloud instances.

.warning
  %b WARNING:
  The current installation process
  %b deletes
  any existing data in your PostgreSQL database.

  %p
    Either ensure that your data is backed up and restorable, or consider
    installing Aeolus Conductor on a box that does not need PostgreSQL for
    any other purpose.

%br

.note
  %p
    %b NOTE 1:
    The current installation process calls for SELinux to be in permissive
    mode.  This is not recommended on a mission-critical machine.

%br

.note
  %p
    %b NOTE 2:
    The current installation works on 64-bit Linux only.  32-bit support is
    planned, but does not work at this time.

  %h2 Aeolus Conductor Configuration

  %ol
    %li
      Open ports 80 and 443 on the firewall, so that (secure) web traffic may
      be served.
      %br
      %br

    %li
      Set SELinux to permissive mode:
      %p
        %pre
          $ sudo setenforce 0

    %li
      Ensure that the time is set correctly.  Failure to do so causes
      connectivity issues with Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2).
      %br
      %br

    %li
      Clean up any existing remnants from an older installation.
