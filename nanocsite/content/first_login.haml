  %h2(id="first-login") 1. Web based interface

  %p
    After Aeolus has been initialized, with any SELinux and firewall updates
    done, you are ready to use the web interface.

  %p
    Open the following address in your web browser (any modern one), using the
    name of your Aeolus server instead of "<b>server_name</b>":

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        https://server_name/conductor

  %p
    %b USEFUL INFO:
    Aeolus is really several pieces of software that work together.
    "Conductor" is the web based user interface piece.  

  %p
    If everything is working properly, the initial login screen will appear:

  %p
    %center
      %a{ :href => "images/getting_started/initial_login_screen.png",
          :target => "_blank" }
        %img.thumbnail{ :src => "images/getting_started/thumbnails/initial_login_screen_thumb.png",
              :title => "Initial login screen - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Initial login screen - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %p
    Login now, using the default administrator details set by
    <b>aeolus-configure</b>:

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %b Username:
    admin
    %br
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %b Password:
    password

  %p
    We'll change that password in a few moments, after introducing you to
    the major parts of the Aeolus interface.

  %h2(id="welcome") 2. Welcome screen

  %p
    Once you've logged in, the main Aeolus web interface appears:

  %p
    %center
      %a{ :href => "images/getting_started/initial_welcome_screen.png",
          :target => "_blank" }
        %img.thumbnail{ :src => "images/getting_started/thumbnails/initial_welcome_screen_thumb.png",
              :title => "Initial welcome screen - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Initial welcome screen - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %p
    The most important parts of the web interface are:
  
  %p
    %dl
      %dt Primary navigation line
      %dd
        This is the horizontal area under the header, containing
        "<b>MONITOR</b>" and "<b>ADMINISTRATION</b>"
        %br
        %br

      %dt Main area
      %dd
        This is the area in the middle of the screen.  In this screenshot it
        contains items such as the "Login successful" message, various
        buttons including "Start", "Stop" and "Delete", along with an empty
        list starting with "DEPLOYMENT NAME".
        %br
        %br

      %dt Details view
      %dd
        Not shown in the above screenshot.  This appears when items are
        selected in the Main area, often presenting additional information
        and options.

    "<b>aeolus user</b>" and the search box.

              :title => "User details shortcut",
              :alt => "User details shortcut" }

    In the drop down menu this opens click "My Account".

  %p

              :title => "Update user details screen - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Update user details screen - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %p
    Change the password now, using the "<b>Change password</b>" and
    "<b>Confirm password</b>" fields.
    %br
    %br
    If you want, also change the First name, Last name, and E-mail fields.
