  %p
    Cloud provider types include Amazon EC2, RHEV-M, Rackspace, etc.  A provider is simply an instance of a provider type - for example, an EC2 region such as us-east-1.  Users may have one or multiple accounts associated with a provider.

  %p
    This guide will configure Aeolus for EC2, as well as a "Mock" provider for those without an available EC2 account.  The mock provider is simply a fake provider used for testing.
