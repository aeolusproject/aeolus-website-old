  %h2 1. Stopping the Instance

  %p
    Shutting down a running instance is very simple.

          :target => "_blank" }

    %ol
      %li
        In the Aeolus web interface, click the
        %b MONITOR
        tab and select the grid view by clicking the grid button on the right side of the page.


      %li
        Click on "Instances" to view your running instances.  Tick the checkbox next to the instance name in the instance list.

      %li
        Click the "Stop selected instances" button.  Within a minute or two the instance status should change to say <em>stopped</em>:

    If you are using Amazon EC2, follow the next step to check for instances running in EC2.

  %h2 2. Check for instances left running in EC2

  %p
    When using a development version of Aeolus, always remember to check the
    AWS Management Console for instances left running in EC2.

  %p
    It's rare for this to happen, but better safe than sorry:
