  %h2(id="first-login") 1. Web based interface

  %p
    After Aeolus has been initialized, with any firewall updates done, you
    are ready to use the web interface.

  %p
    Open the following address in your web browser (any modern one), using the
    name of your Aeolus server instead of "<b>server_name</b>":

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        https://<span style="color:chartreuse">server_name</span>/conductor

  .note
    %p
      %b USEFUL INFO:
      Aeolus is really several pieces of software that work together.
      "Conductor" is the web based user interface piece.

  %p
    If everything is working properly, the initial login screen will appear:

  %p
    %center
      %a{ :href => "images/getting_started/initial_login_screen.png",
          :target => "_blank" }
        %img.thumbnail{ :src => "images/getting_started/thumbnails/initial_login_screen_thumb.png",
              :title => "Initial login screen - click to view at full size in a new window",
              :alt => "Initial login screen - click to view at full size in a new window" }

  %p
    Login now, using the default administrator details set by
    <b>aeolus-configure</b>:

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %b Username:
    admin
    %br
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %b Password:
    password

  %p
    We'll change that password in a few moments, after introducing you to
    the major parts of the Aeolus interface.
