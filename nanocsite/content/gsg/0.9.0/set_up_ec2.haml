.warning
  %b WARNING:
  Amazon and other Cloud providers charge fees for using their products and
  services, including EC2.

  %p
    Setting up EC2 with Aeolus means your Amazon EC2 account will be billed
    with their appropriate usage charges as you follow this guide and/or try
    things out.

  %p
    We
    %b ARE NOT
    responsible for any EC2 or other Cloud fees and charges you may incur.
  
  %p
    As a precaution after finishing every Aeolus testing session, you
    %b must
    manually check all storage and instances in Amazon have been terminated
    and removed as you expect.

  %p
    Development versions of Aeolus have on occasion been known to report
    instances as stopped when they are in fact still running in EC2, thereby
    incurring charges from Amazon.

  %p
    %b BE CAREFUL!
