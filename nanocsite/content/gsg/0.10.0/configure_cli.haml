  %h2 1. Update Aeolus CLI Config

  %p
    Aeolus CLI is a command line tool for creating and managing aeolus images.  The Aeolus CLI Config file is installed in the user's home directory as .aeolus-cli ('~/.aeolus-cli').
    %pre
      :preserve
        :conductor:
          :url: https://localhost/conductor/api
          :username: admin
          :password: password

  %p
    You should update the password to the one you created during the
    <a href="first_login.html">First Login Step</a>.

  %p
    Also make sure that the conductor url is set to where conductor is running with the "/api" postfix and the username is correct.  Unless you have strayed from the default setup, the default values should be sufficient.

      %b NOTE -
      New users who want to create and manage aeolus images from the command line, must install the aeolus-cli and update the config with their own credentials
