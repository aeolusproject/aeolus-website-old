        %b
          iwhd now rejects an attempt to add attribute k/v pair to a
          nonexistent object
        %br
        Before, it would add the attribute, which would then make it appear
        (listing the parent bucket) as if the still-nonexistent object
        existed.

      2nd March 2012: Image Warehouse 1.3 stable release

    %p
      Not much has changed in iwhd per se, but due to e.g., changes in mongod,
      some tests in iwhd-1.2's regression suite were failing. Now they pass.
      Also, Pete Zaitcev documented some of the inner workings.

    %h3 Changes in behavior

    %ul
      %li
        %b
          iwhd --auto (-a) now uses mongod's --nojournal option when possible

        %b
          Translations now come from the translationproject.org, rather than

      Along with build-related fixes and portability improvements via gnulib.

        For a query like this:
        %pre
          $ curl -H 'Accept: */json' http://H:9090/b/o/_attrs
        The response now includes an "object_body" URL of
        "http://H:9090/b/o/", which matches the XML-formatted one, rather
        than "http://H:9090/b/o/body". That same line now ends with a comma,
        too.

      31st October 2011: Image Warehouse 1.0 stable release

    %p
      This is almost a mere relabeling of iwhd-0.991.

    %h3 Improvements (both minor)

    %ul
      %li
        %b Log messages showing when iwhd is started and stopped

    %h3 Known Issues (existing in previous releases too)

    %ul
      %li
        %b iwhd is not very useful without mongod
        %br
        Ideally, iwhd would communicate its inability to do useful work
        when mongod isn't running, and when mongod becomes usable again iwhd
        would, too.  However, currently, attempting to do things like create
        an object or an attribute in iwhd makes iwhd dereference NULL whenever
        mongod is unreachable.

          iwhd now continues to work properly when mongo dies and is

        Prior to this release, it would dump core due to an unhandled
        SocketException.

        %br

      %li
        %b
          iwhd's /etc/init.d startup script now reports failure reliably
        %br
        For example, when failing to start because no MongoDB server is
        running.  Prior to this release, it would print [FAILED], but
        mistakenly exit with status 0 (success). Now it exits with status 1
        to properly indicate an error.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        %b
          Improved handling of RHEV-M 2.x template imports  
        %br
        Adapt to a slight variation in the status report of a template import
        action in RHEV-M 2.x.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        %b
          Time limits on RHEV-M imports have been relaxed
        %br 
        dc-rhev-image now allows a RHEV-M import to take 10 minutes.
        Previously, it would timeout after just 1 minute, which was often
        inadequate.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        %b
          Objection deletion now copes with missing backend file
        %br
        Deleting objects now succeeds when the file system backed file has
        been removed external to iwhd.  Previously, this didn't work properly.

      15th September 2011: Oz version 0.7.0 now available

    %p
      Oz version 0.7.0 has been released.  Release 0.7.0 is a bugfix and
      feature release for Oz.

    %p
      Highlighted improvements of Oz 0.7.0 are:

    %p
      %ul
        %li
          Ability to use the "direct initrd injection" method to install
          Fedora/RHEL guests.  This is an internal implementation detail, but
          can significantly speed up installs for Fedora or RHEL guests.
          (thanks for the tip from Kashyap Chamarthy)
        %li
          Support for Fedora-16 (thanks to Steve Dake for help in making this
          work)
        %li
          Use the serial port to announce guest boot, rather than a network
          port.  This makes it so we no longer have to manipulate iptables, and
          gets us one step closer to having Oz run as non-root
        %li
          (for developers) Re-written unittests in python for speedier execution
        %li
          (for developers) Additional methods in the TDL class to merge in
          external package lists (thanks to Ian McLeod)

    %p
      More documentation on Oz (including links on how to obtain it) is
      available:

      Oz version 0.6.0 has been released.  Release 0.6.0 is a bugfix and
      feature release for Oz.

    %p
      Highlighted improvements of Oz 0.6.0 are:

    %p
      %ul
        %li
          The ability to specify the destination for the ICICLE output
          from oz-install and oz-generate-icicle
        %li
          pydoc class documentation for all internal Oz classes
        %li
          Automatic detection of KVM or QEMU at runtime (this allows oz to be
          used within virtual machines, although with a large performance hit)
        %li
          Less scary warning messages in the debug output
        %li
          Printing of the screenshot path when a build fails
        %li
          Ability to run multiple Oz installs of the same OS at the same time
        %li
          Support for OEL and ScientificLinux
        %li
          Support for RHEL-5.7
        %li
          Support for CentOS 6
        %li
          Support for OpenSUSE arbitrary file injection and command execution
        %li
          Ability to make the TDL (template) parsing enforce a root password
        %li
          Rejection of localhost URLs for repositories (since they must be
          reachable from the guest operating system, localhost URLs make no
          sense)

          A registration to RHEV-M now returns the ID and diagnostic messages

        This permits registration of the same image several times, which

          Adapted to jansson-1.2's new, incompatible, changed API

        We can now build both with it and the older API
        %br
        %br

      %li
        %b
          Do not leave a value of "pending xxxx" remaining in "ami-id"
          attribute in case of an error in registration process.
        %br
        When we did, no application or human administrator could tell if
        there was an error or a hung  registration.

          the template.
        %li
          Building and pushing images now supports multiple targets or
          providers in a single call rather than requiring one to repeat the
          call multiple times. (added in 0.2.0)
        %li
          Source has been cleaned up and DRYed out.  This is an ongoing,

      4th May 2011: New website!

    %p
      The Aeolus Community have launched the second version of our main website.

    %p
      Designed by Kyle Baker from the Red Hat User Experience (UX) Team, this
      one is visually appealing, has a
      %b much
      cleaner look, and is very easy to locate information in.

    %p
      Importantly, this website begins addressing the needs of business and
      non-technical Aeolus users.  A marked improvement over the developer only
      focus of the previous website.

    %p
      It is expected this will be a key piece for Aeolus growing into the
      worlds best cloud deployment software.

    %p
      %b UPDATE:
      Although we mentioned Kyle Baker's UX Design work for the new site,
      we unintentionally forgot to mention
      %a{ :href => "http://jimmac.musichall.cz/",
          :title => "Jakub Steiner's website" } Jakub Steiner's
      significant work.  Jakub created the new Aeolus logo, did the majority
      of the heavy lifting for the site's CSS, plus much more.  Due to his
      effort, the site works well in all major browsers, resizes and scales
      properly, loads quickly, and generally behaves as it should.  Thanks
      Jakub!

    %p
      %a{ :href => "contact.html#business",
          :title => "Let us know what you think" } Let us know
      what you think. :)
