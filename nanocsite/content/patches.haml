%h1 Submitting patches

%p 
  Patches to improve Aeolus are very welcome, and encouraged.

  %h2 Preparing patches

  %p
    Patches should be generated with
    %a(href="http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-format-patch.html")
      %code git format-patch
    and sent to the appropriate mailing list using
    <a href="http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-send-email.html"><code>git send-email</code></a>.

  %p
    %ul
      %li
        %b DO
        include a short summary in your patch as a description, followed by
        all information that would be useful to a reviewer and/or someone
        looking back at git history to see what you did.
        %br
        %br
        For example:
        %pre
          :preserve
              Fix adding account to pool functionality

              We had an issue with blah where we were checking foo instead of
              bar, this resulted in xyz, and required that we abc to get it
              correct again.
        %br

      %li
        %b DON'T
        put all that above info in the first line of your patch.  It makes
        things like
        %code "git log --oneline"
        unreadable.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        %b DO
        use the --compose flag to add a summary explaining your patchset, if
        you think it may be unclear to a reviewer why this is a set vs a
        single patch.  Also use it to add any over-arching details that may
        be missed by reading just the individual commit messages.

  %h2 Where to email them

  %p
    For all parts of Aeolus except Image Warehouse, they should be emailed to
    the
    %a{ :href => "https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/aeolus-devel" } aeolus-devel
    mailing list.
    %br
    %br
    Patches for Image Warehouse should be emailed to the
    %a{ :href => "https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/iwhd-devel" } iwhd-devel
    mailing list.

  %h2 The Review process

  %p
    We use a Submit &rArr; ACK &rArr; Push approach for all patches.
    %br
    %br
    When a patch is submitted, someone familiar with that area of the Aeolus
    code manually reviews it.
    %br
    %br
    When they've finished their review, appropriate feedback is emailed to the
    public mailing list for potential discussion, including either an
    %b ACK
    indicating approval, or 
    %b NACK
    indicating it was rejected.
    %br
    %br
    If the patch was approved, someone with write access to the appropriate git
    repository will then apply the patch.
    %br
    %br
    This approach works well for us, letting us benefit from each others
    knowledge and strengths.  Plus it's a good way for people of all skill
    levels to hone their technique (or teach others).
