%h1 Requirements for using Aeolus

.section-grouping

  %p
    To use Aeolus effectively, the server you install it on must meet these
    requirements:

  %table{ :width => "60%" }
    %tr
      %th{ :width => "25%", :align => "left", :style => "vertical-align: top" }
        Operating System:
      %td{ :style => "padding-bottom: 0.7em" }
        Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 (or higher) 64-bit, CentOS 6.2 (or
        higher) 64-bit, or Fedora 15/16 64-bit.
    %tr
      %th{ :align => "left", :style => "vertical-align: top" }
        CPU:
      %td{ :style => "padding-bottom: 0.7em" }
        1.6Ghz dual core or higher recommended.
    %tr
      %th{ :align => "left", :style => "vertical-align: top" }
        CPU VT extensions:
      %td{ :style => "padding-bottom: 0.7em" }
        Not required for creating Amazon EC2 virtual machine images, or
        importing existing images.
        %br
        %br
        VT extensions
        %b are
        required for creating new
        %b vSphere
        and
        %b RHEV
        virtual machine images.
    %tr
      %th{ :align => "left", :style => "vertical-align: top" } Memory:
      %td{ :style => "padding-bottom: 0.7em" } 2GB or greater.
    %tr
      %th{ :align => "left", :style => "vertical-align: top" } Firewall:
      %td{ :style => "padding-bottom: 0.7em" }
        Must allow web browser connections on tcp port 443 (https).
    %tr
      %th{ :align => "left", :style => "vertical-align: top" } Disk space:
      %td{ :style => "padding-bottom: 0.7em" }
        Less than 1 GB required for the Aeolus software,
        %br
        + sufficient space to hold virtual machine images (may be on network
        storage such as SAN, NAS, or NFS).

  %h2 Cloud provider accounts

  %p
    You also need an account with each Cloud provider you want Aeolus to manage,
    such as Amazon EC2, and/or Rackspace.

  %p
    Creation of these accounts is something you must do outside of Aeolus, using
    the standard sign up procedures for each Cloud provider.

  %p
    %b Note:
    These accounts are completely optional, you do not need to create an
    account with any Cloud provider you don't want Aeolus managing.

  %p
    That being said, our
    %b Getting Started Guide
    is written around having an Amazon EC2 account already, so you will need
    one if you're going to follow that.
