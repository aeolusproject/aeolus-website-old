How to Build the Aeolusproject Website
===================================


Requirements
------------

You need to have Ruby version 1.8 installed, along with the following gems:

* webby
* haml
* rdiscount

Depending on your distribution, you may need to add the directory with `webby`
executable to your $PATH.


Building the Website
--------------------

Aeolusproject website is created using [Webby][1]. It takes a website
defined by a set of layouts, templates and content files, runs a count
of filters on them and produces a static web structure that can be
directly posted to a webserver or displayed in a browser.

[1]: http://webby.rubyforge.org/

To do this, go to the `aeolusproject.org` directory and run `webby`:

    $ cd path/to/docs/aeolusproject.org
    $ webby

The website will be generated in the `aeolusproject.org/output/` directory. To
view it, you can point your browser to that directory.

    file:///path/to/docs/aeolusproject.org/output/

In addition, Webby comes with a little webserver that can make it easier. If
you run:

    $ webby autobuild

The website will be opened in your browser and it will automatically rebuild
itself any time you change its sources.

However, webby does not track the *.mdown files in the docs/docs directory so
the autobuild won't trigger when you change them. You must rebuild them manually
by issuing the `webby` command.


File Structure
--------------

aeolusproject.org/
    - the Aeolus Project website

aeolusproject.org/redmine
    - static redmine content (themes, javascripts, etc)

aeolusproject.org/content/
    - the pages that are displayed on the website

aeolusproject.org/layouts/
    - the structure of the website -- including logo, navigation,
      footers, etc.

aeolusproject.org/output/
    - the final version of the site -- this is what you want to view in a
      web browser
