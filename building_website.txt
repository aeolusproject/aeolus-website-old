How to Build the Aeolusproject Website
===================================

Requirements
------------

You need to have Ruby installed, along with the following gems:

* nanoc
* haml
* sass

Depending on your operating system, you may need to add the directory
with the "nanoc" executable to your $PATH.


Building the Website
--------------------

The Aeolus Project website is created using [nanoc][1]. It takes a website
defined by a set of layouts, templates and content files, runs a count
of filters on them and produces a static web structure that can be
directly posted to a webserver or displayed in a browser.

[1]: http://nanoc.stoneship.org

To do this, go to the "nanocsite" directory and run "nanoc compile":

  $ cd nanocsite
  $ nanoc compile

The website will be generated into the "nanocsite/output/" directory.

To view the output, start nanoc's built in web server, then point your
browser to http://localhost:3000.

  $ nanoc view
  $ firefox http://localhost:3000
